# Creative_Writing_Club
Final MVP project for Coding Dojo (ongoing development)
Final Projects & Algos Submission: The Creative Writing Club MVP

Description:

The Creative Writing Club project was designed to be a simple and free resource for writers new to the craft. It is, of course, free to access for writers of all levels and experiences, but its primary demographic is meant to be for writing students, hobbyists, and anyone just looking for a low-stakes creative community.

Included MVP features;

Writing Prompts: One of the included pages, offers writing prompts to get people thinking outside of the box, to get the writing started. These are currently pre-loaded by the site admin (changed/added to on a regular basis).

Gallery: The gallery is meant to be a visual jumpstart for writers. Sometimes the written word doesn’t get writers into the right headspace to start a story. That’s where visuals can come into play and help with story inspiration.

*Future inclusions: Prompts and the Gallery images will eventually be user contributed, but I lacked the time to properly sort out my vision for what this would look like.

Freewrites: This is the primary feature of the Creative Writing Club site at the moment. Once users login they are taken to their landing page, which offers them the option to view anonymously posted freewrites from others within the community. They can also add contributions of their own.

*Future inclusions: It’s the goal to eventually have users be able to like and comment on other freewrites. It is also in the plans to add a collaborative writing feature where users can participate in an ongoing story, users will alternate turns writing parts of the story until the story deadline at which point a new ongoing story will begin.
